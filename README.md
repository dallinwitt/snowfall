# Snowfall Comparison of Four Western Ski Resorts
## Data Analysis and Visualization

#### Motivation
As an avid skier, I want to plan trips that take me to places where I am the most likely to experience favorable conditions. In this project, I analyzed snowfall patterns over the last decade at four different ski resorts. The data came from the now defunct website [On The Snow](onthesnow.com).

#### Methods
I used Python to analyze the four datasets, which were in the form of flat text files. The datasets were all quite messy, with lots of missing values, and certain values that jumped erratically, in ways that did not make logical sense. I had to put some time into restructuring and cleaning the data, but was able to impute values that at least did not entirely misrepresent the fundamental characteristics of the snowfall for any given season.

#### Outcomes
I was surprised to learn that, despite the heavy and consistent snowfall at Jackson Hole, my home resort of Snowbird consistently holds onto its snow much better, with a base depth that ends above 200 centimeters with relative consistency.
